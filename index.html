<h2>About me<h2>
<small>
  <p>Hi, my name is Lesli Ruiz. I was born and raised in Cincinnati OH. I am currenly a sophmore at the Univeristy of cincinnati majoring in Media Communciations &#128187;. I aspire to be a graphic deisgner and a photographer.</small></p>
  
<p><small>My favorite class that I have taken in college so far has been media design &#10024;. We had so many opportunies to express ourselves in our work. I am looking foward to learning more about design as the years go by. You can find my portfolio at <a href="https://ruizlp7f84.myportfolio.com/proficiency-portfolio">https://ruizlp7f84.myportfolio.com/proficiency-portfolio</a> </p>

<p> I am the oldest in my family. My family is from Mexico. I would love to go to Mexico one day and visit my family. There are many places to explore, and I feel like it would be so fun especially with my family. 
  <p> When I graduate, I plan on traveling &#9992; and exploring new places. I also hope to have a job that I love. Learning a new language is also on my bucket list.</p>
